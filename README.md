## Description
This Landing page is built with the help of HTML and Sass(Scss). Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is 
interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass Script is the scripting language itself. Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, 
called "the indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules. The 
newer syntax, SCSS (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to separate rules within a block. 
The indented syntax and SCSS files are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss, respectively. Sass is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, 
variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. 

This project is built in an old fashion way without use of flexbox and grid. Insted is applied custom grid classes and float property. The values of the colors, 
margins and paddings are stored in custom variables. To clear after the float property and to center the elements I used mixins, where these blocks of code 
are stored. For the HTML structure is used Element Block Modifier (EBM). For Sass installation here is used NPM package called Node SASS. The project is 
responsive and supports all browsers. It has a finished Building workflow and it is ready for production.

## Preparation and installation of Node Sass

1 Open the smd or VSC terminal to check if Node.js is already installed writing the next command:

node -v

2 Download the Node.js from the official website

https://nodejs.org/en

3. Creating our package.json with the next command:
