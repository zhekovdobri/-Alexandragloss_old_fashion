## Description
This Landing page is built with the help of HTML and Sass(Scss). Sass (syntactically awesome style sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that is 
interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Sass Script is the scripting language itself. It is an extension of CSS, adding nested rules, 
variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. 

This project is built in an old fashion way without use of flexbox and grid. Insted is applied custom grid classes and float property. The values of the colors, 
margins and paddings are stored in custom variables. To clear after the float property and to center the elements I used mixins, where these blocks of code 
are stored. For the HTML structure is used Element Block Modifier (EBM). For Sass installation here is used NPM package called Node SASS. The project is fully responsive and can be used of all types of devices and browsers. It has a finished Building workflow and it is ready for production.
